# My Personal Project - A Restaurant Tracker
## Proposal

I plan to build a restaurant tracker. Using this tracker, the user will be able to store information
about restaurants they have been to. Sometimes, it is difficult to remember which restaurants were good and which were
not, so this tracker can be something that the user refers back to often. They can choose whether they liked the
restaurant and write a list of items they liked with their prices, and a list of items they disliked.

The application can be useful for anyone, but those who visit many different restaurants often, may find it more useful.
Additionally, those who tend to be forgetful may find it useful too! Personally, one of the reasons that I am interested
in building this project is because find that I often forget the name of a good restaurant that I have been to, and 
sometimes forget the names of good food that were there. Having a tracker that I can refer back to often, is something 
that may be useful.
